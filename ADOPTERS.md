# KAI Scheduler Adopters

This document lists organizations that have adopted KAI Scheduler — either to run their own workloads on Kubernetes, or to integrate it into the products and services they offer.

If your organization is using KAI Scheduler, we would love to have you listed here! Check out [Add Your Organization](#add-your-organization) below to get started.

## Adoption Phases

- **Evaluation**: Evaluating KAI Scheduler for fit against infrastructure and feature requirements.
- **Staging**: Adopted; rolling out in pre-production or staging environments.
- **Production**: Running KAI Scheduler in production.

## Organization Types

- **End User**: Uses KAI Scheduler to manage internal workloads or services.
- **Platform / Provider**: Integrates KAI Scheduler into a product, managed service, or platform offered to customers.
